things to improve

the contact button makes the contact page dissaper when clicked. 
have the mobile display work properly.

the page needs breakpoints on all pieces

the contact bar shrinks down and doesn't display as intended, need to update so that the element displays on the entire page. with the option to hide it. 

the contact page font size for inputs must scale to so that the user can see all that they are typing. 


the contact bar will be in the closed position when in mobile display as its default.

the splash and spacers flow inside the app size which is only at 80 percent. barely readable

the agent page covers the photo, font is to small and the element is larger then its parent. 

the community page gets to small and the photos fall to the bottom of the element. 

the footer doesnt cover the whole buttom and the info is falling out of it. 


I need to get my buttons uniform. 
I need to find my values and change them to percentages for Responsive design.
