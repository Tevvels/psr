        desc:"I moved to Ashland in 1975, and was captured by its beauty.  I became a Realtor in 1977 and opened my own company in 1987.  My husband David joined me in 1989.  We are co owners and principal brokers of Patricia Sprague Real Estate. When I started my company I did not realize I would still be in real estate this long.  But the truth is I still love it, and what I love the most about real estate is the people I meet and work with.  For most people real estate is the biggest investment they will make in a lifetime, and the saying “Home Sweet Home” is still true, especially now in these times. For me there is nothing more wonderful than seeing the happiness when one finds the home they love, or the excitement when someone finds a great investment, as well as when they sell, and anticipating a new future.The other joy I find in real estate are the people that work with us in our company. We are like a small family and they have the values and integrity that is so important to me for our company. Some of our agents started out as my clients. And some have been with us for over 20 years, it is always a pleasure to come to the office and see their friendly faces. This is a very challenging time.  When I first got into real estate the interest rate was 19%.  That was also challenging.  And now more then ever it is important to be able to give as much professionalism as well as caring for every client, and hopefully have their experience in purchasing or selling, be as smooth and enjoyable as possible. When a customer comes through our door, I feel it is a great honor, and I appreciate the business they bring to our office.Patricia and David are blessed with a loving family of 4 children.",
